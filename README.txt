These files are Bit-based Division Properties of S7 and S9 on KASUMI.
We express Bit-based Division Properties of S-box as follows.
(Input Bit-based Division Property) -> (Output Bit-based Division Properties)

For example:
(0000001)  -> (0000001), (0000010), (0000100), (0001000), (0010000), (0100000), (1000000),

If we choose Input Bit-based Division Property of S7 as (0000001),
we can get 7 Output Bit-based Division Properties
(0000001), (0000010), (0000100), (0001000), (0010000), (0100000), and (1000000).
